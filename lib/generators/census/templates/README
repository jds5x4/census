Next:

1. In order for the question admin views to work, you'll need to include both
   jQuery and the census.js file in your application layout. To enable drag-and-drop
   sorting of questions and choices in the census admin, you'll also need to
   include jQuery UI.

     <%= javascript_include_tag 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js' %>
     <%= javascript_include_tag 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/jquery-ui.min.js' %>
     <%= javascript_include_tag 'census' %>

2. If you'd like the Census admin pages to look nicer, include the provided census.css
   file in your application layout.

     <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'census' %>

3. Add a link to the question admin page somewhere in your app:

     <%= link_to 'Set up questions', census_admin_path %>

4. Include the partial that displays answers in your user show page:

     <%= render 'census/user_answers', :user => @user %>

5. Include the partial that allows the user to enter answers in your user
   edit page:

     <%= render 'census/user_questions', :user => @user %>

6. Migrate your database:

     rake db:migrate
